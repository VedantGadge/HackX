# 🎯 CAPTION DUPLICATION - VISUAL FIX GUIDE

## The Problem (Visual)

```
YouTube Caption Display (During Transition):
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ OLD ELEMENT 1: "The"                     │ ← Still visible
│ OLD ELEMENT 2: "airplane"                │
│ ────────────────────────────────────────│
│ NEW ELEMENT: "The airplane taxied"       │ ← Current
│ ────────────────────────────────────────│
│ aria-label="The airplane taxied..."      │ ← Combined all!
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

Our extraction was joining EVERYTHING:
"The" + "airplane" + "The airplane taxied"
= "The The airplane airplane taxied"

```
T=0s   "The The"
       🌐 Request → [the, the]
       📊 Queue: [the, the] ✗

       🌐 Request → [taxi, taxi]
       📊 Queue: [the, the, airplane, airplane, taxi, taxi] ✗✗✗

RESULT: Exponential growth of duplicates! 😱
```

### AFTER (Fixed) ✅

```
T=0s   "The"
       🌐 Request → [the]
       📊 Queue: [the] ✓

## How Deduplication Works

```
Step 1: Split into words
"The The airplane airplane"
→ [The, The, airplane, airplane]

Step 2: Compare each word to previous
[T] [T] [A] [A]
 1st 2nd 1st 2nd

Step 3: Skip if same as previous (case-insensitive)
[✓] [✗] [✓] [✗]
Keep Skip Keep Skip

Step 4: Join remaining words
[The, airplane]
→ "The airplane"
```

---

## Throttling System

```
Time Flow:
────────────────────────────────────→

T=0s  "Hello" → Process ✅
      lastProcessedCaption = "Hello"
      lastProcessedTime = 0

T=0.5s "Hello" → Throttle check
       Same text? YES
       2 seconds passed? NO (only 0.5s)
       → SKIP ✗

T=2.1s "Hello" → Throttle check
       Same text? YES
       2 seconds passed? YES (2.1s > 2s)
       → PROCESS ✅

T=2.5s "World" → Throttle check
       Same text? NO
       → PROCESS ✅

## Edge Cases Handled

```
Edge Case 1: Intentional Repetition
Input:  "Go go go!"
Output: "Go !" 
Status: Minor issue, acceptable for ASL

Edge Case 2: Case Sensitivity
Input:  "Hello hello"
Output: "Hello" (correctly recognized as duplicate)

Edge Case 3: Multiple Duplicates
Input:  "The the the airplane airplane airplane"
Output: "The airplane" (all duplicates removed)

Edge Case 4: No Duplicates
Input:  "Hello world"
Output: "Hello world" (unchanged)

Edge Case 5: Similar but Different
Input:  "there they"
Output: "there they" (correctly preserved)
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Video (< 30 seconds)

```
Expected:
- ~10-15 unique captions
- ~2-5 backend requests (after dedup)
- ~5-10 videos queued
- Console clean, easy to read

Check:
✓ No "The The" in output
✓ No excessive requests
✓ Videos play smoothly
```

### Scenario 2: Fast-Paced Captions

```
Expected:
- ~20-30 unique captions
- ~5-10 backend requests
- ~20-40 videos queued
- Smooth playback

Check:
✓ No "word word" pattern
✓ Throttling prevents same caption twice
✓ Queue stays reasonable
```

### Scenario 3: Slow Captions

```
Expected:
- ~3-5 unique captions
- ~1-3 backend requests
- ~3-7 videos queued
- Slow, clear playback

Check:
✓ Each caption once
✓ Clean console
✓ Perfect timing
```
