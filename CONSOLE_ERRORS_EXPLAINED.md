## What's Really Happening

### ❌ The Real Issue (Not an error, just a status)

```
⚠️ No caption containers found. Make sure captions are enabled on the video.
```

**Translation:** "I'm looking for YouTube captions, but I can't find them. This means either:
1. CC button isn't clicked
2. Video doesn't have captions
3. Captions are turned off"

### ✅ The Solution (What I Just Fixed)

I updated `content.js` to:
1. ✅ Show a **BIG CLEAR MESSAGE** telling you to click CC
2. ✅ **Automatically detect** when CC is clicked
3. ✅ **Automatically switch** to observer mode once captions appear
4. ✅ Keep **aggressively polling** every 500ms while waiting

---

## What to Do Now

### Step 1: Reload Extension
```
1. Go to: chrome://extensions
2. Find: Intellify extension
3. Click: 🔄 Reload button
```

### Step 2: Go to YouTube
```
1. Open any YouTube video
2. Look for CC button (bottom-right of player)
3. CLICK IT! (should turn blue/highlighted)
4. See white text captions appear on video
```

### Step 3: Open DevTools
```
1. Press: F12 on keyboard
2. Click: Console tab
3. You'll see the extension logs here
```

### Step 4: Start Caption Capture
```
1. Click Intellify icon in toolbar
2. Click "Start Caption Capture" button
3. Watch the console output
```

### Step 5: Expected Console Messages

**First (when no captions visible):**
```
❌ CAPTIONS NOT VISIBLE ON THIS VIDEO
👉 FIX: Click the "CC" button on YouTube
⏳ I'm monitoring for captions... (checking every 500ms)
```

**Then (after you click CC):**
```
✅ Captions detected! Switching to observer mode...
✅ Caption capture started - watching for caption changes
```

**Then (when caption appears):**
```
📝 New caption detected: "We are going to college"
🌐 TOKENIZATION REQUEST
✅ TOKENIZATION SUCCESS
   Mapped tokens: [we, go, college]
▶️ PLAYING VIDEO CLIP: we
```

## About Those Other Errors

### 1. `[Violation] Permissions policy violation: unload`
- **What:** YouTube security policy
- **Cause:** YouTube restricts browser behaviors
- **Our impact:** None - we don't use unload events
- **Action:** Ignore completely

### 2. `Failed to load resource: 403`
- **What:** YouTube CDN rejecting video request
- **Cause:** Network timeout, geo-restriction, rate limit, or format unavailable
- **Our impact:** None - we have our own videos in `/videos/` folder
- **Action:** Ignore completely

### 3. `Banner not shown: beforeinstallpromptevent`
- **What:** Chrome PWA installation prompt blocked
- **Cause:** Page prevented it (which is fine)
- **Our impact:** None - we're not a PWA
- **Action:** Ignore completely

---

## What Changed in Code

**File:** `chrome_extension/content.js`

**Added:**
1. ✅ Better error message (with box border in console)
2. ✅ Clear instruction to click CC button
3. ✅ Persistent monitoring message
4. ✅ Auto-detection when captions appear
5. ✅ Auto-switch to observer mode

**Before:**
```javascript
console.warn('💡 Make sure captions are ENABLED on the video (click CC button)');
console.log('✅ Fallback polling observer started (500ms interval)');
```

**After:**
```javascript
console.warn('═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════');
console.warn('❌ CAPTIONS NOT VISIBLE ON THIS VIDEO');
console.warn('═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════');
console.warn('');
console.warn('👉 FIX: Click the "CC" (closed captions) button on YouTube');
console.warn('   It\'s usually in the bottom-right corner of the video player');
console.warn('');
console.warn('⏳ I\'m monitoring for captions... (checking every 500ms)');
console.warn('   Once you enable CC, I\'ll automatically start capturing');
console.warn('');
console.warn('═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════');

// Plus auto-detection that switches to observer mode
```
