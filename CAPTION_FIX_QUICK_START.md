# 🚀 Quick Start - YouTube Caption Fix

## The Issue
Browser extension couldn't detect YouTube captions → No reverse video translation appeared on overlay

## The Root Cause  
- YouTube's DOM structure changed
- Extension was looking for old CSS selectors (`.captions-text`)
- No fallback if selectors weren't found

## The Fix ✅
Updated `content.js` with:
1. **Multiple modern selectors** that work with current YouTube
2. **Polling fallback** (1 second checks) if initial selectors fail  
3. **Dual detection** (MutationObserver + polling)
4. **Better logging** to identify issues

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Reload Extension (takes 2 seconds)
```
1. Go to: chrome://extensions
2. Find: "Intellify" extension
3. Click: 🔄 Reload button
```

### Step 2: Test on YouTube (takes 1 minute)
```
1. Go to youtube.com
2. Pick a video WITH captions (CC button visible)
3. Click extension icon → verify Backend URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000
4. Click: "Start Caption Capture"
5. Open DevTools: F12 → Console tab
```

### Step 3: Watch Console for Confirmation
You should see:
```
🎬 Starting caption capture...
✅ Using selector: .ytp-caption-segment
✅ Caption capture started
💡 Backup polling enabled every 1 second
📝 New caption detected: "your caption text"
🌐 TOKENIZATION REQUEST
✅ TOKENIZATION SUCCESS
```

---

## ✅ If It Works Now

**Congratulations!** The captions are now being detected. 

**Next steps:**
- Make sure backend is running: `python app.py`
- Verify `videos/` folder has `.mp4` files (at least `we.mp4`, `go.mp4`)
- Watch the overlay for sign language videos

---

## ❌ If It Still Doesn't Work

### Symptom 1: "Found 0 caption container(s)"
**Cause:** Captions aren't enabled or YouTube DOM changed again

**Fix:**
1. Click CC button on YouTube - captions must be visible
2. Hard refresh page: Ctrl+Shift+R
3. Try again

**If still not working:**
- Right-click on caption → Inspect
- Look for the `class` name (e.g., `ytp-caption-segment`)
- Report what you see

### Symptom 2: Captions detected but no backend response
**Cause:** Backend not running or unreachable

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Check if backend is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/health

# If returns error, start backend:
cd D:\Final_Intellify\Intellify-Final-Project\Intellify-Final-Project
python app.py
```

### Symptom 3: Backend responds but no videos play
**Cause:** No videos in `videos/` folder

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Check videos folder
dir videos\ | head -20

# Add .mp4 files named as tokens:
# Example: we.mp4, go.mp4, college.mp4, etc.
```

## 🔍 Detailed Logs Reference

### What Changed in Code

**File:** `chrome_extension/content.js`

**New variables:**
```javascript
let captionPoller = null;        // Polling timer
let captureEnabled = false;      // Track state
```

**New function:**
```javascript
extractCaptionText()             // Try multiple ways to get caption
```

**Updated function:**
```javascript
startCaptureCaptions()           // Now tries selectors + polling
stopCaptureCaptions()            // Now clears poller too
toggleCaptureCaptions()          // Uses captureEnabled flag
```

**Selectors tried (in order):**
1. `.captions-text` (old YouTube)
2. `.ytp-caption-segment` (modern YouTube) ⭐ **MOST LIKELY TO WORK**
3. `.ytp-caption` (alternative)
4. `[aria-label*="caption"]` (accessibility)
5. `.a-text[jsname]` (Google framework)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Video with captions enabled:
1. ✅ Click extension icon
2. ✅ Click "Start Caption Capture"  
3. ✅ Captions appear on YouTube
4. ✅ Overlay shows "Next: TOKEN · TOKEN · TOKEN"
5. ✅ Sign language videos play in overlay

### If ANY step fails:
- Check console (F12) for error logs
- Verify backend is running
- Check `videos/` folder exists and has `.mp4` files

## 🔄 Reset Steps (if needed)

```powershell
# 1. Reload extension
chrome://extensions → Find Intellify → Click Reload

# 2. Hard refresh YouTube page
Ctrl + Shift + R

# 3. Start backend fresh
cd D:\Final_Intellify\Intellify-Final-Project\Intellify-Final-Project
python app.py

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Before:** "Found 0 caption container(s)" → Extension couldn't detect captions
- **Now:** Multiple selectors + polling → Should work with modern YouTube
- **If still broken:** We can debug further with actual DOM inspection

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

**For testing:** Try these YouTube videos that definitely have captions:
- Any TED Talk video
- News videos (BBC, CNN, etc.)
- Search: "how to make" + any topic (usually has captions)

**Performance:** If CPU usage is high:
- Stop caption capture when not needed (toggle off)
- Reduce polling frequency (edit `content.js` line 198)

**Debugging:** Keep DevTools open:
- Console tab → See all logs
- Network tab → Check `/tokenize-text` requests
- Application tab → Check stored backend URL

---

## 🆘 Still Broken?

Run this diagnostic:
```javascript
// Copy & paste in console on YouTube:
console.log("=== CAPTION DIAGNOSTIC ===");
console.log("Checking selectors:");
['.captions-text', '.ytp-caption-segment', '.ytp-caption', '[aria-label*="caption"]']
  .forEach(s => console.log(s + ": " + document.querySelectorAll(s).length + " found"));
console.log("=== END ===");
```

Share the output with the issue details.
