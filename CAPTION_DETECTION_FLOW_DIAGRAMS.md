# 📊 Caption Detection Flow - Visual Guide

## BEFORE FIX (Broken) ❌

```
YouTube Page Loads
    ↓
Extension tries to find ".captions-text" selector
    ↓
NOT FOUND on modern YouTube (uses .ytp-caption-segment instead)
    ↓
Extension: "Found 0 caption containers"
    ↓
No MutationObserver set up
    ↓
Caption appears on YouTube
    ↓
No detection
    ↓
🎬 SIGN LANGUAGE VIDEO: ❌ NOT PLAYING
```

---

## AFTER FIX (Working) ✅

```
YouTube Page Loads
    ↓
Extension tries selectors in order:
    1. ".captions-text" → Not found (0 elements)
    2. ".ytp-caption-segment" → FOUND! (2 elements) ✅
    3. (no need to try more)
    ↓
Extension sets up:
    • MutationObserver on caption containers (real-time)
    • Polling timer every 1 second (backup)
    ↓
Caption appears on YouTube
    ↓
    ├─ MutationObserver detects DOM change ✅
    └─ → Calls extractCaptionText()
        ├─ Tries modern selectors → FOUND
        └─ Returns: "We are going to college"
    ↓
processCaption("We are going to college") called
    ↓
POST to backend: /tokenize-text
    ↓
Backend responds: tokens = [we, go, college]
    ↓
enqueueTokens([we, go, college])
    ↓
playNextFromQueue()
    ↓
🎬 SIGN LANGUAGE VIDEOS: ✅ PLAYING IN OVERLAY
```

## Caption Extraction Flow

```
extractCaptionText() called
    ↓
METHOD 1: Query ".ytp-caption-segment" + ".captions-text span"
    │
    ├─ Found text? → Return it ✅
    └─ Not found? → Continue ↓
    ↓
METHOD 2: Query ".ytp-caption-window-bottom .captions-text"
    │
    ├─ Found text? → Return it ✅
    └─ Not found? → Continue ↓
    ↓
METHOD 3: Find video player element
    ├─ Query for elements with aria-label or .a-text
    │
    ├─ Found text (length < 500)? → Return it ✅
    └─ Not found? → Return null ❌
```

---

## Dual Detection System

```
startCaptureCaptions()
    ↓
    ├─ Setup: MutationObserver on caption containers
    │  │
    │  ├─ Watches for: childList, subtree, characterData changes
    │  └─ Fire: When DOM mutates (real-time)
    │
    ├─ Setup: Polling timer (1000ms interval)
    │  │
    │  ├─ Checks: extractCaptionText() every 1 second
    │  └─ Fire: Catches mutations observer might miss
    │
    └─ Result: Multiple ways to detect same event = high reliability
```

---

## Error Handling Flow

```
startCaptureCaptions() called
    ↓
Find caption containers with selectors
    ↓
    ├─ FOUND (captionContainers.length > 0)
    │  │
    │  ├─ Setup MutationObserver ✅
    │  ├─ Setup polling (1s) ✅
    │  └─ Return
    │
    └─ NOT FOUND (captionContainers.length === 0)
       │
       ├─ Setup aggressive polling (500ms) ✅
       ├─ Log warning: "No container found, using polling"
       ├─ Log hint: "Enable CC button"
       └─ Return

    → Poll every 500ms until captions appear
    → Once found, upgrade to normal polling (1s)
```

---

## Selector Priority & Fallback

```
Selector Attempt 1: ".captions-text"
    │
    ├─ Found elements? (count > 0) → USE IT ✅
    ├─ Not found? → Try next
    └─ Result: 0 elements on modern YouTube
    ↓
Selector Attempt 2: ".ytp-caption-segment"
    │
    ├─ Found elements? → USE IT ✅ ← MOST COMMON
    └─ Not found? → Try next
    ↓
Selector Attempt 3: ".ytp-caption"
    │
    ├─ Found elements? → USE IT ✅
    └─ Not found? → Try next
    ↓
Selector Attempt 4: "[aria-label*='caption']"
    │
    ├─ Found elements? → USE IT ✅
    └─ Not found? → Try next
    ↓
Selector Attempt 5: ".a-text[jsname]"
    │
    ├─ Found elements? → USE IT ✅
    └─ Not found? → Use polling as fallback
    ↓
Fallback: Polling mechanism
    └─ Check extractCaptionText() every 500ms
       (tries all methods internally)
```

## State Management

```
Extension Lifecycle:
    ↓
window.addEventListener('load')
    └─ initOverlay() → Create UI
    └─ captureEnabled = false
    └─ captionObserver = null
    └─ captionPoller = null
    ↓
User clicks "Toggle" button
    ├─ First click → captureEnabled = true
    │  └─ startCaptureCaptions()
    │     ├─ Set up observer
    │     └─ Set up polling
    │
    └─ Second click → captureEnabled = false
       └─ stopCaptureCaptions()
          ├─ Disconnect observer
          ├─ Clear polling interval
          └─ Set both to null
```

CPU Usage Over Time:

Before Fix (Broken):

After Fix (Normal):
▁▂▁▂▁▂▁▂▁▂  1-2% (polling once per second)

After Fix (Actively Capturing):
